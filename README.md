Capuchin Monkey – Characteristics, Description, Price, Nutrition
Having an exotic pet at home is the dream of many people since childhood. Capuchin monkeys are a species of small primates that, in terms of behavior and intelligence, closely resemble humans. What should you know about these animals? Is domestic breeding of capuchins legal in Poland?
Species Description and Characteristics
The capuchin monkey is a species of mammal belonging to the order of primates, naturally found in Central and South America. These animals form groups in tropical forest areas, where a hierarchical system based on developed social relationships among individuals is observed. Capuchins stand out among other monkey species for their high intelligence and ability to use simple tools.
Lifestyle
Capuchin monkeys live in groups ranging from a few to several dozen individuals. They are omnivores, as their diet in the wild includes tropical fruits, insects, and small lizards. They spend most of their time in the treetops, searching for food and resting. In the case of capuchins near human settlements, monkeys are also known to steal food from homes and trash cans.
Fur and Coloration
The fur of capuchins is short and dense, with various shades of brown and gray. The name "capuchin" comes from the pattern on the top of their heads, resembling a hat or hood. The fur around the abdomen and inner parts of the limbs is usually lighter, while the coloration of the dorsal region is darker, providing significant sun protection in their natural habitat.
Size and Weight
Capuchins are associated with small-sized individuals, but the size of each monkey can vary depending on the species. The capuchin monkeys, known as tufted capuchins, can exceed 50 centimeters in length, with a body weight of up to 5 kilograms. On the other hand, black-capped capuchins are one of the smallest classified species, with a body length of 40 centimeters and a total weight of up to 3 kilograms. The size of individual monkeys also depends on factors such as age and gender.
Character and Behavior
The developed social skills of capuchins contribute to a high level of empathy and care for their companions in the group. While these monkeys are rarely aggressive, defensive behavior can be observed in individuals fighting for food or territory. The hierarchy within a group is determined by the dominance and position of selected individuals who take control of the entire group. Capuchins are highly active animals, spending most of their day agilely moving in the treetops, facilitated by their dexterous limbs and tail.
Disposition and Training
Capuchins are gentle animals in their natural environment, but in some cases, individuals living in captivity may become less predictable over time. The behavior of wild animals changes due to contact with humans, making the training process challenging. Due to their high level of intelligence, these monkeys can perform specific tasks, such as sitting or responding to specific commands. However, even years of training may not eliminate wild behaviors characteristic of exotic animals.
Lifespan of Capuchins
The average lifespan of capuchin monkeys is 15 to 25 years. Individuals living in captivity can even reach 30 or 40 years, thanks to medical care and access to suitable nutrition provided by breeders.
How to Care for Their Health?
Basic care for capuchins involves providing a balanced diet, medical care, and suitable living conditions for each individual. As omnivores, capuchins require a balanced diet, reflecting the nutritional components of their natural environment, even in captivity. Capuchins undergo vaccination programs to protect them from infectious diseases that can be transmitted by other monkey species. Proper adaptation of capuchin enclosures to their needs, including cleanliness, ample space, access to trees, and climbing routes, is crucial for the proper development of these animals.
Common Diseases
Common diseases in capuchins include fungal and parasitic infections, affecting the skin and the animal's digestive system. Respiratory diseases, similar to those in humans, can also be life-threatening to capuchin monkeys. Breeders taking care of capuchins should also pay attention to behavioral disorders resulting from improper upbringing or harmful living conditions.
Special Characteristics
Among the most recognizable features of capuchins are their distinctive fur coloration around the head, agile tail, and the high frequency of tool use and simple constructions from stones and sticks for obtaining food and playing. Capuchins are incredibly intelligent animals, exhibiting behaviors that may resemble human actions in some aspects.
Grooming
Grooming capuchins involves regular cleaning of their fur and monitoring the condition of their teeth. The proper development of capuchins can only occur if the animals are provided with the right living, nutritional, and behavioral conditions. Therefore, the proper adaptation of cages and enclosures plays a significant role in keeping these animals in our country.
Brushing Their Fur
In their natural environment, capuchins groom their fur independently through a process called "luskanie." However, for captive animals, proper brushing of their fur is necessary to prevent the accumulation of parasites and matting of dead hair, which could lead to the development of severe diseases.
Shedding of Fur
Shedding is a natural process of hair replacement in many animals. Similarly, capuchins experience fur shedding to maintain a healthy fur appearance. For this species, shedding is not dependent on a specific season, but the process usually intensifies in the fall and spring.
Breeding and Young
Owning a capuchin in Poland is possible, but it requires meeting several conditions. This includes obtaining permission from the General Director of Environmental Protection for breeding exotic animals. This request must be supported by the submission of appropriate documents confirming the possession of the necessary conditions for the animal's maintenance. In legal breeding, capuchins can breed freely, but the number of offspring in a litter usually consists of only one young monkey.
History of the Breed
The first capuchins lived nearly 6 million years ago in the current South America. Over the years, this species evolved and diversified into specific varieties and subspecies. Capuchins gained popularity in Europe thanks to the conquistadors who transported them on their ships from the 18th century. Since then, capuchins have become one of the most popular exotic animal species in Europe, and they can still be seen in most zoos on the continent.
Handling Heat and Cold
Capuchins originate from a tropical climate, so they have specific requirements regarding environmental temperature. These monkeys prefer temperatures ranging from 18 to 27 degrees Celsius, with optimal air humidity ranging from 50 to 70 percent.
For Whom?
Capuchins are wild animals that can also live in captivity under favorable conditions. They require proper care and patience, so breeders must meet all legal requirements, and caregivers must have the right approach to these animals. This includes not only the level of knowledge but also empathy, care, and the right attitude in caring for exotic animals.
Breed Origin
Capuchins belong to the Cebidae subfamily, which includes New World monkeys. Evolutionarily, this species is most closely related to monkeys in the uakari and saki groups, from which it separated about 10 million years ago.
Interesting Facts About Capuchin Monkeys
Capuchins exhibit many extraordinary abilities that, from a human perspective, seem very similar to those of the human species. Recognizing their reflection in the mirror, imitating the use of simple tools, cracking nuts with stones, and recognizing individuals categorized as enemies or friends are just some of their remarkable traits. Additionally, capuchins have a highly developed sense of hearing, allowing them to communicate with other individuals of their species using various sounds and calls. In some countries, capuchins are also used in therapy for individuals with emotional disorders and disabilities, serving the same role as horses and dogs in Europe.
Price in 2023
Depending on the specific species, the price of one individual can range from 5,000 to 40,000 Polish zlotys. However, it's important to note that purchasing a young capuchin from a breeder is not the only formality that a future owner will have to deal with. Additional costs include adapting the enclosure to the monkey's needs, medical care, and proper nutrition. Therefore, capuchin breeding in Poland is relatively expensive, leading to only a few breeders opting to acquire them.

Penguins and Family Life: It begins with the choice of a young wife. Every young penguin goes for a walk for this purpose—that is, to the beach, where penguins spend most of the day. Having chosen a partner, the penguin tilts its head and lets itself be admired. Then, apparently receiving the penguin's approval, they go to the nesting grounds. She resists and stops from time to time. Finally, beaks approach each other, and the birds kiss. Such a kiss lasts 10–15 seconds, during which the groom tries to embrace the bride with his short wings.
After the wedding ceremony, the birds build a nest together, decorating it with sticks, stones, and sparse vegetation, inhabited by penguins of rocky coasts. During rest periods, they go to the beach and swim.
Two weeks after the wedding, the first egg appears in the nest. The parents debate over the newcomer, but it doesn't prevent them from taking care of it immediately. Seagulls and other winged thieves, amateurs of penguin eggs, closely watch over the disheveled parents. The parents take turns incubating the egg, changing every 12 hours. Then more eggs appear: two, three, four, but never more. Finally, something hatches: dirty, thin, and ugly. From that moment on, the heavy duties of feeding begin until the young ones learn to swim and forage for themselves.
However, there are times when parents never return from hunting. The little orphans set out on their own from the nest, walking to strange nests, begging for food. Almost never does another family—burdened with concerns for their own offspring—adopt the orphans. Repelled, deprived of care, hungry, and helpless after each of their begging journeys, they return to their own nest. After a little rest, they fruitlessly search for food again. Then, they no longer have the strength to move, and finally, after a few days, a bird like a seagull or ibis cleans the penguin bones of the remaining flesh.
Betrayals in marriage are a separate chapter. A penguin returning to the nest finds a stranger next to the spouse—it fights with him. Sometimes the traitor sides with the stranger. The birds fight fiercely, pecking each other to blood. However, when the spouse prevails over the lover, the female returns to her husband's side and helps him remove the intruder from their nest. Then, tired from the fight, the birds cuddle up to each other and fall asleep peacefully.
Penguins and Poland: The first Polish scientist who encountered penguins was likely Professor Jerzy Forster from the University of Vilnius, a participant in Captain Cook's famous subantarctic expedition (1772/74). Adam Mierosławski, the brother of revolutionary Ludwik Mierosławski, a sailor, traveler, and discoverer of the forgotten islands of New Amsterdam and St. Paul, undoubtedly had a closer acquaintance with the penguins inhabiting these islands. Finally, Polish participants in the "Belgica" expedition to Antarctica (1897–99), Arctowski and A.B. Dobrowolski, observed penguins in their homeland, and Dobrowolski interestingly described their habits in his memoirs.
Penguins and Literature: In ancient times, as described in Anatole France's "The Penguin Island," the pious monk Maël, traveling the oceans, reached an unknown island.
"The reflection of the polar ice weakened the old man's eyes, but the faint light penetrated his swollen eyelids. He distinguished living shapes that gathered like a crowd of people on the steps of an amphitheater. At the same time, his ears, deafened by the long roar of the sea, heard faint voices. Stepping onto a stone in the middle of this gigantic wild amphitheater, he said:
— Inhabitants of this island, although you are small in stature, you seem not so much fishermen as the Senate of a wise republic. By your dignity, silence, calm behavior, you constitute an assembly on these wild rocks, which can be compared to Roman senators advising in the temple of Victory, or rather to Athenian philosophers debating on the benches of the Areopagus. I suspect that you are simple and good. Running across your island, I saw no signs of murder or traces of slaughter.
Now, what Maël took for people of small stature but serious movements were penguins, gathered in spring and paired on the natural steps of the rock, standing majestically with their thick, white bellies. At times, they moved their flippers like arms and emitted peaceful cries. With friendly curiosity, they turned their small, round eyes, surrounded by an oval spot, towards him, giving their gaze a strange and human expression. The penguins responded with cries from the depths of their throats. Their voices sounded sweet because they were in the season of love."
About what happened next when the pious monk baptized the penguins, mistaking them for people—the book tells.
There is also the extremely popular English publishing house "Penguin," publishing many cheap books.
Penguins and Social Issues: Penguins like to live in crowds. When they descend from their nests in the morning and go to the beach, a multi-thousand, talkative crowd is drawn to the sea. Mothers' voices can be heard, calling their impatient young ones, who eagerly move forward. The elders stay behind the procession. Swimming, fishing in the sea for mollusks, and frolicking on the beach are mass and collective activities.
Penguins cannot stand albinos. A bird that, instead of a black tailcoat and a black-marked head, is clad in a white shirt from head to toe, is exposed to harassment and malice from other birds. Especially poor is the young albino, who, unable to respond to the sarcastic blows inflicted by the stronger one, is often abandoned by its own mother.
Annually from February to December, during the 6-7 week period, social life has its cucumber season. Birds lose weight, become ugly, and completely lose their mood. These are weeks of tragic changes in plumage. During this time, birds
